# Developing a Barcode Scanner with Expo Barcode Scanner in React Native

Barcode scanning is used in industry, retail and many places.

Developing an app that makes use of this feature is very common in companies' daily lives.

Thinking about solving this, we are going to implement barcode reading with React Native, where, after reading the barcode, we can consult a data source to show the data of a product, simulating what would happen in a supermarket.
